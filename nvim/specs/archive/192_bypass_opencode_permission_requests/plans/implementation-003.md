## Overview

This unified plan addresses both root causes of opencode permission requests: (1) plugin-level permission UI that displays permission dialogs, and (2) /tmp/ directory access triggers that generate permission events. The solution combines disabling permission events in opencode.nvim with migrating all temporary file usage from /tmp/ to specs/tmp/ for consistency across both .claude/ and .opencode/ systems.

Claude Code and opencode are completely separate systems with independent permission architectures. The user has Claude Code configured with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (working correctly), but opencode has no equivalent CLI flag. Permission requests in opencode must be addressed through plugin configuration and eliminating external directory access patterns.

### Research Integration

**Research-001.md (Permission Hooks)**:
Investigated PreToolUse hook mechanism for auto-allowing /tmp/* access. Hooks can return `{"permissionDecision": "allow"}` to bypass permission prompts. This approach was superseded by the cleaner specs/tmp/ migration.

**Research-002.md (specs/tmp/ Migration)**:
Analyzed the remaining 161 occurrences of /tmp/ in .claude/ files that need migration to specs/tmp/. The .opencode/ system was already migrated in task OC_156. Documented file priority groups and migration patterns.

**Research-003.md (Permission System Analysis)**:
Critical finding: Claude Code and opencode are separate systems. The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag only affects Claude Code, not opencode. The actual control for opencode permission UI is `events.permissions.enabled` in the plugin configuration. The deprecated `permission_requests = "notify"` setting does not prevent permission dialogs.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Disable permission UI in opencode.nvim by setting `events.permissions.enabled = false`
- Remove deprecated `permission_requests = "notify"` setting from opencode.lua
- Migrate all /tmp/ references in .claude/ commands to specs/tmp/
- Migrate all /tmp/ references in .claude/ scripts to specs/tmp/
- Migrate all /tmp/ references in .claude/ skills to specs/tmp/
- Migrate all /tmp/ references in .claude/ hooks to specs/tmp/
- Update documentation to reflect new temporary file patterns
- Ensure both .claude/ and .opencode/ use specs/tmp/ consistently
- Verify no permission prompts occur after implementation

**Non-Goals**:
- Modifying Claude Code configuration (already correctly configured)
- Adding opencode CLI flags (none exist for permission bypass)
- Implementing PreToolUse hooks (superseded by migration approach)
- Changing any logic or functionality beyond paths and settings
- Modifying files outside .claude/ directory (except opencode.lua)
- Creating new temporary file conventions (follow existing pattern)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Operations fail silently after disabling permission UI | Medium | Low | Monitor opencode behavior; permissions can be re-enabled quickly |
| Missed /tmp/ occurrences | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive grep search before and after migration |
| opencode.lua syntax errors | High | Low | Validate Lua syntax before saving; test plugin loads correctly |
| Concurrent file access issues | Low | Low | specs/tmp/ maintains same atomic semantics as /tmp/ |
| User confusion about separate permission systems | High | Medium | Document clearly that Claude Code and opencode are independent |
| Accidentally modifying wrong files | Medium | Low | Use version control; review all changes before committing |

- [ ] Atomic file operations preserved (temp file + mv pattern)
- [ ] Temporary files created in specs/tmp/
- [ ] Temporary files properly cleaned up after operations
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and functional

## Artifacts & Outputs

- `lua/neotex/plugins/ai/opencode.lua` - Updated with disabled permissions
- `.claude/` directory with all /tmp/ references migrated to specs/tmp/
- Backup archive of original .claude/ state
- Migration log documenting all files modified
- Verification report showing:
  - opencode.lua configuration correct
  - Zero remaining /tmp/ references
  - No permission prompts during testing

## Rollback/Contingency

### If opencode.lua changes cause issues:
1. Restore original opencode.lua from version control
2. Or manually change `enabled = false` back to `enabled = true`
3. Reload Neovim configuration
4. Verify opencode functions normally

### If /tmp/ migration causes issues:
1. Stop all operations and assess the issue
2. Restore from backup: Extract backup archive to restore original .claude/ state
3. Verify restoration: Run commands to ensure they work as before
4. Remove backup after confirming stability

### If specific files cause problems:
1. Restore only the problematic files from backup
2. Investigate the specific issue with those files
3. Fix and retry migration for those specific files
4. Keep other migrated files intact

### If permission prompts still appear:
1. Check that specs/tmp/ has correct permissions (755, user-owned)
2. Verify opencode.lua has `events.permissions.enabled = false`
3. Verify files are actually being created in specs/tmp/
4. Check for any remaining /tmp/ references that were missed
5. Consider that some operations may require permissions regardless of UI settings

### If atomic file operations break:
1. Verify specs/tmp/ is on the same filesystem as the target files
2. Check that mv operations use correct paths
3. Ensure temp files are created in correct location before move

## Migration Pattern Reference

### Standard Pattern Being Migrated:
```bash
# Before:
jq '...' specs/state.json > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json specs/state.json

# After:
jq '...' specs/state.json > specs/tmp/state.json && mv specs/tmp/state.json specs/state.json
```

### opencode.lua Configuration Change:
```lua
-- Before:
events = {
  enabled = true,
  reload = true,
  permissions = {
    enabled = true,  -- Shows permission UI
    idle_delay_ms = 1000,
  },
},
permission_requests = "notify",  -- DEPRECATED

-- After:
events = {
  enabled = true,
  reload = true,
  permissions = {
    enabled = false,  -- NO PERMISSION UI
  },
},
-- permission_requests removed
```

## Historical Context

This implementation combines findings from three research reports:

1. **Research-001**: Explored PreToolUse hooks as alternative approach
2. **Research-002**: Documented the /tmp/ to specs/tmp/ migration pattern (already done for .opencode/ in task OC_156)
3. **Research-003**: Discovered the critical difference between Claude Code and opencode permission systems, identifying `events.permissions.enabled` as the actual control for opencode permission UI

The specs/tmp/ migration approach was chosen over hooks because it is:
- Simpler and more maintainable
- Already proven in the .opencode/ system
- Eliminates permission triggers at the source
- Requires no ongoing hook maintenance

After this implementation, both agent systems (.claude/ and .opencode/) will:
- Use specs/tmp/ for all temporary files
- Have consistent temporary file conventions
- Minimize permission request triggers

The opencode.nvim plugin will have permission UI disabled, while Claude Code continues to use its --dangerously-skip-permissions flag.
