## Overview

This plan addresses the security and permission issues caused by writing temporary files to `/tmp/` when updating `specs/state.json` using `jq`. The solution replaces all `/tmp/state.json` patterns with `specs/tmp/state.json` throughout the `.opencode/` agent system, using a user-owned directory that avoids SELinux, AppArmor, and container permission prompts.

The migration affects 85+ occurrences across 4 priority groups: Core Commands (14), Skills (20+), Context Documentation (35+), and Scripts (9).

### Research Integration

Research report research-001.md identified the problem pattern:
```bash
# Before
jq '...' specs/state.json > /tmp/state.json && mv /tmp/state.json specs/state.json

# After
jq '...' specs/state.json > specs/tmp/state.json && mv specs/tmp/state.json specs/state.json
```

The `specs/tmp/` directory already exists and is user-owned, making it the ideal replacement location.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Replace all `/tmp/state.json` occurrences with `specs/tmp/state.json` in .opencode/ agent system
- Eliminate permission prompts in SELinux, AppArmor, container, and macOS environments
- Update all 85+ affected locations across 21 files
- Ensure all jq atomic write patterns use the new temporary location
- Verify no `/tmp/state.json` references remain after migration

**Non-Goals**:
- Modifying actual jq logic or state.json structure
- Changing the atomic write pattern itself (still using tmp + mv)
- Adding new functionality beyond path replacement
- Modifying system-wide /tmp usage outside .opencode/
- Creating new temporary directories (specs/tmp/ already exists)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Missing occurrences during grep | Medium | Low | Multi-pass verification with different grep patterns, including `/tmp/state.json` and `> /tmp/` |
| Syntax errors in shell scripts | High | Low | Use sed with dry-run first, verify each file after edit |
| Breaking existing workflows | High | Low | Maintain identical atomic pattern (jq > tmp && mv), only change path |
| specs/tmp/ directory missing | High | Low | Verify directory exists at start, create if needed |
| Race conditions with concurrent access | Low | Low | specs/tmp/ is user-owned like /tmp, same atomic semantics apply |
| Partial migration leaving mixed patterns | Medium | Low | Systematic phase-by-phase approach with verification after each phase |

## Rollback/Contingency

**If migration causes issues**:

1. **Immediate rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Use git to revert all changes
   git checkout -- .opencode/
   ```

2. **Partial rollback** (specific file):
   ```bash
   git checkout -- .opencode/commands/research.md
   ```

3. **If specs/tmp/ has issues**:
   - Verify directory ownership: `ls -ld specs/tmp/`
   - Fix permissions: `chmod 755 specs/tmp/`
   - Alternative: Create dedicated tmp directory in .opencode/ instead

4. **Emergency restoration**:
   - All changes are to documentation/command files (no binary changes)
   - Simple text replacement can restore original /tmp/state.json pattern
   - No database or state corruption risk

**Prevention measures**:
- Each phase is independent and can be rolled back separately
- All changes are simple string replacements (low risk)
- Atomic pattern (jq > tmp && mv) is preserved exactly
- Original pattern can be restored via reverse sed if needed
