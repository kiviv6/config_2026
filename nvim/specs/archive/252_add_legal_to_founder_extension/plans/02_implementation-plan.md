# Implementation Plan: Task #252

- **Task**: 252 - add_legal_to_founder_extension
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: specs/252_add_legal_to_founder_extension/reports/02_team-research.md
- **Artifacts**: plans/02_implementation-plan.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: meta
- **Lean Intent**: false

## Overview

Add contract review and legal counsel capability to the founder extension. This implementation creates a complete command-skill-agent stack following established founder extension patterns (market-agent, skill-market, /market) with legal domain-specific content. The work integrates findings from team research including structural patterns (Teammate A) and legal domain content (Teammate B).

### Research Integration

Integrated research report `02_team-research.md` covering:
- File inventory (7 new files, 3 modified files)
- Execution flow patterns (agent 9 stages, skill 11 stages, command STAGE 0 + CHECKPOINT pattern)
- Legal domain content (IP assignment, indemnification, data rights, etc.)
- Modes: REVIEW, NEGOTIATE, TERMS, DILIGENCE
- Pre-task forcing questions for contract type, concerns, position, financial exposure

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Create legal-council-agent with 4 operational modes and forcing question framework
- Create skill-legal thin wrapper with postflight handling
- Create /legal command with pre-task forcing questions (STAGE 0 pattern)
- Create 3 context files (legal-frameworks.md, contract-review.md, contract-analysis.md)
- Create Typst template for PDF report generation
- Update manifest.json and index-entries.json with routing
- Document in EXTENSION.md

**Non-Goals**:
- Creating legal-specific plan/implement agents (reuse founder-plan-agent and founder-implement-agent)
- Integrating external MCP servers (legal analysis is internal, unlike market-agent's sec-edgar)
- Providing actual legal advice (agent outputs are research/analysis for founder review)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Pattern drift from other founder agents | M | M | Copy from market-agent exactly, only change domain content |
| Incomplete index-entries.json integration | M | L | Follow existing entries structure precisely |
| Manifest routing conflicts | H | L | Use "founder:legal" key pattern matching existing routing |
| Context file too large | M | M | Keep each file under 300 lines per research recommendation |
