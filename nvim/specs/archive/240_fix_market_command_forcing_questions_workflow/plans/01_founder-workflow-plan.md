# Implementation Plan: Task #240

- **Task**: 240 - Fix /market command forcing questions workflow
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: [01_market-workflow-research.md](../reports/01_market-workflow-research.md)
- **Artifacts**: plans/01_founder-workflow-plan.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: meta

## Overview

Restructure the founder extension commands (/market, /analyze, /strategy) to ask forcing questions BEFORE task creation, using gathered data to create richer task entries. Add a `task_type` field to enable type-based routing for finer-grained control over /research, /plan, and /implement behavior on founder tasks. This aligns founder commands with the pre-task data gathering pattern requested in tasks 233/234 but with reversed sequencing.

### Research Integration

Key findings from research report 01_market-workflow-research.md:
- Current implementation creates task FIRST, then runs forcing questions during research phase
- Requested workflow reverses this: forcing questions FIRST, then task creation with gathered data
- All three commands (/market, /analyze, /strategy) need the same restructuring
- manifest.json routing currently uses `language: "founder"` for all tasks, not differentiating types
- Type-based routing would enable /research to route to appropriate agent based on task_type

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Restructure /market, /analyze, /strategy to ask forcing questions BEFORE task creation
- Store forcing question Q&A data in task metadata
- Add `task_type` field to state.json schema for founder tasks
- Update manifest.json routing to support task_type-based research routing
- Ensure uniform implementation across all three founder commands

**Non-Goals**:
- Adding new forcing questions (use existing questions)
- Changing the typst output generation (already working via task 238)
- Modifying /plan or /implement commands (they already work correctly)
- Adding new modes to the existing commands

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking existing quick mode (--quick) | Medium | Low | Preserve --quick path unchanged, only modify task workflow mode |
| Task creation fails after questions answered | High | Low | Capture Q&A in temp file before task creation, enable recovery |
| state.json schema change breaks existing tasks | High | Medium | Make task_type optional with null default for backward compatibility |
| Commands become too long/complex | Medium | Medium | Extract pre-task question flow to shared helper function |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Schema Update for task_type Field [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Add `task_type` field to state.json schema and update documentation

- [ ] Add task_type to state.json Entry section (optional field, values: market|analyze|strategy|null)
- [ ] Update TODO.md Entry format to include task_type display

**Timing**: 30 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/rules/state-management.md` - Add task_type field documentation

**Verification**:
- Documentation correctly describes task_type as optional field
- Values are constrained to market|analyze|strategy|null

- All three commands maintain backward compatibility
- --quick mode bypasses pre-task questions correctly

---

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] /market "description" asks mode + essential questions BEFORE task creation
- [ ] /analyze "description" asks mode + essential questions BEFORE task creation
- [ ] /strategy "description" asks mode + essential questions BEFORE task creation
- [ ] Task created includes task_type field in state.json
- [ ] /research {N} routes correctly based on task_type
- [ ] --quick mode bypasses pre-task questions for all commands
- [ ] Existing tasks without task_type continue to work (backward compatibility)
- [ ] /plan and /implement unaffected by changes

## Artifacts & Outputs

- Updated commands: market.md, analyze.md, strategy.md
- Updated skills: skill-market/SKILL.md, skill-analyze/SKILL.md, skill-strategy/SKILL.md
- Updated manifest: manifest.json
- Updated documentation: state-management.md, EXTENSION.md
- Updated /research: research.md

## Rollback/Contingency

If pre-task forcing questions prove disruptive:
1. Revert commands to original flow (task first, questions in research)
2. Keep task_type field (harmless addition)
3. Consider making pre-task questions optional via a flag (--quick-task)

The key safety net is that --quick mode remains unchanged, providing an escape hatch for users who prefer the old flow.
