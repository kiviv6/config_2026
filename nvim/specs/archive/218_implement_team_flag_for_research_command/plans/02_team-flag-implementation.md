# Implementation Plan: Task #218

- **Task**: 218 - implement_team_flag_for_research_command
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Effort**: 12-16 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: [01_team-flag-research.md](../reports/01_team-flag-research.md)
- **Artifacts**: plans/02_team-flag-implementation.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: meta

## Overview

Implement the `--team` flag for `/research`, `/plan`, and `/implement` commands to enable parallel multi-agent research using the experimental Claude Code agent teams feature. The implementation adds flag parsing stages to existing commands, creates three new team skills (team-research, team-plan, team-implement), and supporting infrastructure for wave-based parallel execution with synthesis.

### Research Integration

The research report identified:
- ProofChecker has a complete reference implementation
- Current nvim commands lack any flag parsing
- Experimental feature requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
- Graceful degradation to single-agent is mandatory
- Team mode uses ~5x token cost (default team_size=2 minimizes cost)

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Add `--team` and `--team-size N` flags to `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement` commands
- Create team skills that orchestrate parallel teammates with synthesis
- Implement graceful degradation when experimental feature unavailable
- Support wave-based execution with optional Wave 2 for gap filling
- Integrate with existing language-based routing

**Non-Goals**:
- Successor teammate pattern (follow-up task for context exhaustion)
- Extension language support for team mode (extensions handle their own team logic)
- Advanced conflict resolution algorithms (start with simple synthesis)
- Wave 2 automation (manual trigger only in v1)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Experimental feature instability | H | M | Mandatory graceful degradation to single-agent |
| Token cost increase (~5x) | M | H | Default team_size=2, document cost implications |
| Synthesis quality | M | M | Start with Wave 1 only, simple synthesis logic |
| Command complexity increase | L | M | Clean flag parsing pattern, reusable helpers |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Flag Parsing Infrastructure [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Add STAGE 1.5: PARSE FLAGS to all three commands with shared patterns

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Options section to research.md documenting `--team` and `--team-size N` flags
- [ ] Add STAGE 1.5: PARSE FLAGS between CHECKPOINT 1 and STAGE 2 in research.md
- [ ] Extract flags from remaining args, clean focus_prompt
- [ ] Add team routing override logic (when --team, route to skill-team-research)
- [ ] Add Options section and STAGE 1.5 to plan.md
- [ ] Add team routing override to plan.md (when --team, route to skill-team-plan)
- [ ] Add Options section and STAGE 1.5 to implement.md
- [ ] Add team routing override to implement.md (when --team, route to skill-team-implement)

**Timing**: 2-3 hours

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/commands/research.md` - Add options, flag parsing, team routing
- `.claude/commands/plan.md` - Add options, flag parsing, team routing
- `.claude/commands/implement.md` - Add options, flag parsing, team routing

**Verification**:
- Commands accept --team and --team-size flags
- Flags are extracted from args (not passed as focus text)
- Without --team, commands behave identically to current

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] `/research 218 --team` produces multi-teammate research
- [ ] `/research 218 --team` without env var falls back gracefully
- [ ] `/plan 218 --team` produces plan with alternatives
- [ ] `/implement 218 --team` parallelizes independent phases

- `.claude/skills/skill-team-research/SKILL.md` (new)
- `.claude/skills/skill-team-plan/SKILL.md` (new)
- `.claude/skills/skill-team-implement/SKILL.md` (new)
- `.claude/utils/team-wave-helpers.md` (new)
- `.claude/context/core/patterns/team-orchestration.md` (new)
- `.claude/context/core/formats/team-metadata-extension.md` (new)

- `.claude/context/index.json` (modified)
- `specs/218_implement_team_flag_for_research_command/summaries/03_team-flag-summary.md` (generated)

## Rollback/Contingency

If team mode causes issues:
1. Commands still work without --team flag (existing paths unchanged)
2. Remove team routing overrides from STAGE 2 in commands
3. Team skills can be deleted without affecting core functionality
4. Graceful degradation ensures single-agent always available

If experimental feature is removed from Claude Code:
1. Graceful degradation already handles this
2. Document deprecation in CLAUDE.md
3. Remove team flag documentation from commands
