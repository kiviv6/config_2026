# Implementation Plan: Task #248

- **Task**: 248 - Implement vault archival and number reset in /todo when tasks exceed 1000
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: [02_vault-renumbering-research.md](../reports/02_vault-renumbering-research.md)
- **Artifacts**: plans/01_vault-archival-plan.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: meta
- **Lean Intent**: false

## Overview

This plan implements vault archival functionality in the /todo command. When `next_project_number` exceeds 1000, the system moves the current archive to a numbered vault, resets task numbering, and renumbers active tasks > 1000. The state template already includes `project_numbering.policy: "increment_modulo_1000"`, indicating this feature was anticipated during initial design.

### Research Integration

Key findings from research report 02_vault-renumbering-research.md:
- Five components need modification: skill-todo, state.json schema, directory operations, TODO.md updates, documentation
- The vault operation involves 6 sub-phases: detection, confirmation, vault creation, renumbering, reset, and TODO.md header update
- Directory renaming must handle both 3-digit and 4-digit padded directories
- Dependencies between tasks > 1000 must also be renumbered

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Implement vault threshold detection (next_project_number > 1000)
- Create vault directory structure with metadata
- Renumber active tasks > 1000 by subtracting 1000
- Update all artifact paths and dependencies during renumbering
- Rename task directories from 4-digit to 3-digit padding
- Reset next_project_number after renumbering
- Document vault operation in CLAUDE.md and rules

**Non-Goals**:
- Automatic vault triggering without user confirmation
- Vault rollback/undo functionality
- Cross-vault task references
- Vault merging or consolidation

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Directory rename failure | Medium | Low | Validate source exists before rename; atomic transaction |
| Artifact path mismatch | High | Medium | Use jq for atomic updates; validate paths after update |
| Broken dependencies | High | Medium | Update dependencies in same transaction as renumber |
| Partial completion | High | Low | Implement transaction with rollback markers |
| Race condition | Medium | Low | Lock state files during vault operation |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Schema Extensions [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Add vault-related fields to state schema template and documentation

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add `vault_history` array to state-template.json
- [ ] Update state-json-schema.md with vault field documentation
- [ ] Add vault_history entry schema with fields: vault_number, vault_dir, created_at, task_range, archived_count, final_task_number

**Timing**: 30 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/context/core/templates/state-template.json` - Add vault_count and vault_history fields
- `.claude/context/core/reference/state-json-schema.md` - Document vault schema

**Verification**:

  - vault_number, created_at, task_range, archived_count, last_task_number
- [ ] Reinitialize empty specs/archive/ with fresh state.json

**Timing**: 45 minutes

- [ ] Verify directories renamed from 4-digit to 3-digit format
- [ ] Verify artifact paths updated in state.json
- [ ] Verify dependencies updated
- [ ] Verify TODO.md entries updated
- [ ] Verify vault_history entry accurate

## Artifacts & Outputs

- plans/01_vault-archival-plan.md (this file)
- summaries/02_vault-archival-summary.md (after implementation)
- Modified files:
  - `.claude/skills/skill-todo/SKILL.md`
  - `.claude/context/core/templates/state-template.json`
  - `.claude/context/core/reference/state-json-schema.md`
  - `.claude/commands/todo.md`
  - `.claude/rules/state-management.md`
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Rollback/Contingency

If vault operation fails mid-execution:
1. Restore archive from vault directory (mv specs/vault/{NN-vault}/archive/* specs/archive/)
2. Restore archive/state.json from vault
3. Manually revert state.json active_projects to pre-renumber state
4. Remove vault directory
5. Decrement vault_count
6. Remove vault_history entry

For atomic safety, implement progress markers:
- `.vault_in_progress` - Created at vault start, removed on success
- Contains: vault_number, original_next_project_number, renumber_mappings
- On next /todo run: detect marker and offer recovery options
