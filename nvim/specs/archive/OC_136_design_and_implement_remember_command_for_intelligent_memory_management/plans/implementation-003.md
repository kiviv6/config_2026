## Overview

This implementation plan creates a simple-but-effective memory management system using an Obsidian-compatible vault at `.opencode/memory/`. The approach leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for lookup and storage, avoiding complex custom indexing. The system provides a `/remember` command that accepts text or file paths, analyzes content, compares with existing memories, and proposes additions via interactive checkbox confirmation (similar to the `/learn` command pattern).

**Core Philosophy**: Start simple, get it working, then iterate. Phase 1 delivers minimal viable functionality; future phases can add advanced features like auto-tagging and semantic search.

### Research Integration

**research-001.md**: Comprehensive analysis of memory management patterns, identifying key requirements for content analysis, deduplication, and interactive workflows.

**research-002.md**: Analysis of OC_135 revert impact revealing that skills must use direct execution pattern (like skill-learn) rather than thin wrapper + agent delegation. This informs the skill architecture.

**research-003.md**: Obsidian integration research showing advantages of plain Markdown, bidirectional links, and AI ecosystem compatibility. Recommends hybrid indexing for vaults under 1,000 memories.

**research-004.md**: Simplified design specification recommending `.opencode/memory/` vault structure, MCP server integration, `--remember` flag for `/research`, and minimal viable implementation.

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- [ ] Create `.opencode/memory/` vault with proper Obsidian configuration
- [ ] Implement `/remember` command with checkbox-based interactive confirmation
- [ ] Support adding new memories and updating existing similar memories
- [ ] Integrate with MCP server for memory search and retrieval
- [ ] Add `--remember` flag to `/research` command for memory-augmented research

### Non-Goals
- Complex custom indexing systems (use MCP built-in search)
- Automatic content analysis and tagging (Phase 2+)
- Semantic search and vector embeddings (Phase 3+)
- PARA method integration (Phase 4+)
- Memory freshness scoring (Phase 5+)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| MCP server not available | High | Medium | Graceful degradation - skip memory search, proceed with direct file access |
| User doesn't have Obsidian | High | Low | Document Obsidian requirement; direct file access still works without MCP |
| Vault grows beyond 1,000 memories | Medium | Low | Document best practices for manual organization; transition to Phase 3+ if needed |
| Git conflicts in index.md | Low | Medium | Simple list structure makes merges easy; document conflict resolution |
| Checkbox UI confusion | Low | Low | Clear documentation of multi-select behavior with examples |
| Context injection failures in planning | High | High | Manually verify plan format compliance; this plan demonstrates correct format |

## Rollback/Contingency

If implementation must be reverted:

1. **Remove created files**:
   - Delete `.opencode/memory/` directory
   - Delete `.opencode/commands/remember.md`
   - Delete `.opencode/skills/skill-remember/`
   - Delete `.opencode/docs/memory-*.md`

2. **Revert state changes**:
   - Remove plan artifact from state.json
   - Update TODO.md to remove completed items

3. **Git cleanup**:
   - Revert commits related to memory system
   - Or manually delete files and commit removal

4. **No data loss risk**: Memory vault is additive only; removing it doesn't affect other OpenCode functionality

## Revision History

- **v001**: Initial plan with simple yes/no confirmation
- **v002**: Changed to checkbox-based multi-select (similar to /learn) - **NON-COMPLIANT FORMAT**
- **v003**: Reformatted to follow plan-format.md specification exactly (this version)

## Next Steps

After plan approval, run `/implement OC_136` to begin Phase 1 implementation.

**Phase 1 can begin immediately** - no blockers or external dependencies required.
