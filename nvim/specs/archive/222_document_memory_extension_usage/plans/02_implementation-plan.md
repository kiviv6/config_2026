# Implementation Plan: Task #222

- **Task**: 222 - document_memory_extension_usage
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Research Inputs**: [01_memory-extension-analysis.md](../reports/01_memory-extension-analysis.md)
- **Artifacts**: plans/02_implementation-plan.md (this file)
- **Standards**: plan-format.md, status-markers.md, artifact-management.md, tasks.md
- **Type**: meta

## Overview

Create comprehensive documentation for the memory extension that explains how memories are stored (file structure, naming, format) and how they are used (retrieval, matching, context loading). The documentation will be written to `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md`, replacing the existing minimal navigation-only content with detailed usage guidance based on research findings.

### Research Integration

Key findings from the research report:
- Three-operation model (UPDATE, EXTEND, CREATE) based on overlap scoring
- Obsidian-compatible vault at `.memory/` with specific directory structure
- MCP integration with graceful grep fallback
- Content mapping/segmentation for large inputs
- Topic-based organization with hierarchical paths
- Mandatory user confirmation for all write operations

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Document the vault structure and file format clearly
- Explain the three memory operations with examples
- Describe retrieval mechanisms (MCP and grep fallback)
- Provide actionable usage guidance for the /learn command
- Set clear user expectations for the interactive workflow

**Non-Goals**:
- Modifying the memory extension implementation
- Adding new features or capabilities
- Creating installation or deployment automation
- Documenting MCP server internals beyond usage

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Documentation becomes outdated if implementation changes | M | L | Reference SKILL.md as source of truth, keep docs focused on stable APIs |
| Users confused by Obsidian dependency | M | M | Clearly distinguish MCP-required vs grep-fallback features |
| Information overload | M | M | Use clear sections, quick reference, and progressive disclosure |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Structure and Quick Start [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Establish document structure and provide immediate actionable guidance

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create document outline with section headers
- [ ] Write Quick Start section with load command and basic usage
- [ ] Add command reference table for /learn modes

**Timing**: 20 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Complete rewrite

**Verification**:
- Document has clear section hierarchy
- Quick Start enables immediate usage within 1 minute of reading

---

### Phase 2: Storage Mechanisms [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Document how memories are stored (addressing user's primary concern)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Document vault directory structure (.memory/ layout)
- [ ] Explain memory file format (YAML frontmatter, markdown body)
- [ ] Describe naming convention (MEM-{semantic-slug}.md)
- [ ] Document index.md structure and purpose
- [ ] Include ASCII diagram of vault organization

**Timing**: 30 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Add Storage section

**Verification**:
- Reader can understand where files live without examining filesystem
- File format is clear enough to create memories manually

---

### Phase 3: Usage Patterns [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Document how memories are used (addressing user's secondary concern)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Document three memory operations (UPDATE, EXTEND, CREATE)
- [ ] Explain overlap scoring thresholds (>60%, 30-60%, <30%)
- [ ] Describe content mapping/segmentation behavior
- [ ] Document MCP tools and grep fallback
- [ ] Add examples for each /learn input mode
- [ ] Explain the interactive confirmation workflow

**Timing**: 40 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Add Usage section

**Verification**:
- Each operation type is distinguished clearly
- User understands why they see UPDATE vs CREATE prompts

---

### Phase 4: Configuration and Troubleshooting [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Provide setup guidance and common issue resolution

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Document MCP server options (WebSocket vs REST)
- [ ] Explain prerequisites (Obsidian, Node.js)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Document graceful degradation behavior
- [ ] Add best practices for memory organization

**Timing**: 20 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Add Configuration and Troubleshooting sections

**Verification**:
- User can diagnose "no memories found" issues
- MCP connection testing is documented

---

### Phase 5: Final Review and Navigation [COMPLETED]

**Goal**: Ensure completeness, consistency, and proper navigation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review all sections for clarity and accuracy
- [ ] Ensure navigation links to subdirectories are preserved
- [ ] Add cross-references to related context files
- [ ] Verify no emojis in file content (encoding standard)
- [ ] Test all internal links are valid

**Timing**: 10 minutes

**Files to modify**:
- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Final edits

**Verification**:
- Document passes visual review
- All links resolve correctly
- No encoding issues

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] README.md renders correctly in markdown viewer
- [ ] Quick Start section enables first-time use
- [ ] Storage section answers "where do my memories go?"
- [ ] Usage section answers "how does /learn decide what to do?"
- [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses common MCP issues
- [ ] No broken internal links

## Artifacts & Outputs

- `.claude/extensions/memory/README.md` - Complete documentation (primary output)
- `specs/222_document_memory_extension_usage/summaries/03_documentation-summary.md` - Implementation summary

## Rollback/Contingency

The existing README.md is minimal (navigation-only). If implementation fails:
1. Restore original navigation structure
2. Add partial content as separate usage-guide.md
3. Link from README.md to new file
